### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Reid! I love to build things with code, and I'm a wannabe functional programmer.  
I am a fan of [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and I'm learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) right now.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@8bitReid](https://twitter.com/8bitreid)  
:rocket: Iâ€™m currently learning [ZIO](https://zio.dev/)   
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Scala  
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm learning to shoot 35mm film, but I'm not a photographer... I just like to take pictures.
